Hello this is aproject for my MS587 class. I created an ARG or an Augmented Reality Game using websites, this current update is to work on it's own and I am working on the dynamic version as well.
Please feel free to explore the code. 
WARNING THERE IS A JUMPSCARE AND SCARDEYCAT itself holds the files to the dynamic website so if you would like to play the same as intended,
you can download the files and run the app.py
